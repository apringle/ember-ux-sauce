Once that's done, you can checkout the branch you want to create the gh-page from (likely master) and run the command to build and commit it.

Then run ember github-pages:commit --message "some commit message" in order to rebuild gh-pages branch.

git checkout master
ember github-pages:commit --message "Initial gh-pages release"
git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
```
